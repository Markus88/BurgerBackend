Had little to no free time available today, but i created an empty project with Swagger. Tried two different boilerplates but had issues with VS 2022 Preview and Nuget packages.

I drew a quick ER diagram on a paper of the lower layer. Later after dinner i had some spare time to make a quick N-tier architecture application. I hardly belive that
this will be the final form. The scope of the assignment, leans more towards a serverless application, based on the fact that it has to store "large" amounts of data
in the form of images etc. And the fact that the assignment hints of scaling. A serverless application would be able to scale by the amount needed for the customer.

Currently my idea is to make a N-tier minor version, hopefully with a small static website to show some minor stuff. But time is running out and i haven't had that much spare time today,
so my focus will continue on this monolithic architecture. This is mostly to show some basic skills around coding but i hope i will get some ekstra time to make a diagram of a serverless way to solve this
assignment.

But aktual work today, consisted of a small ER-diagram and creating a small database within MS SQL. Then i added some more strukture to the project and hope i will get it done tomorrow. I should have a few more
available hours there.
