  Had little to no free time available today, but i created an empty project with Swagger. Tried two different boilerplates but had issues with VS 2022 Preview and Nuget packages.

  I drew a quick ER diagram on a paper of the lower layer. Later after dinner i had some spare time to make a quick N-tier architecture application. I hardly belive that 
  this will be the final form. The scope of the assignment, leans more towards a serverless application, based on the fact that it has to store "large" amounts of data
  in the form of images etc. And the fact that the assignment hints of scaling. A serverless application would be able to scale by the amount needed for the customer.
